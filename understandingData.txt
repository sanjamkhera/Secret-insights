# Algorithm for Generating Natal Charts

1. **Input Data**
   - Birth date and time
   - Birth location (latitude and longitude)
   - Celestial data for the birth date/time (similar to the provided JSON)

2. **Calculate Planetary Positions**
   - For each planet (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto):
     - Extract Right Ascension (RA) and Declination from celestial data
     - Convert RA and Declination to ecliptic longitude (zodiac position)
     - Determine zodiac sign and degree based on ecliptic longitude

3. **Determine Ascendant and Houses**
   - Calculate Local Sidereal Time (LST) for birth time and location
   - Use LST and birth location to calculate Ascendant
   - Calculate cusps for all 12 houses

4. **Identify Aspects**
   - Compare angular distances between planets
   - Identify major aspects (conjunction, opposition, trine, square, sextile)

5. **Generate Chart**
   - Plot zodiac wheel
   - Place planets in their respective signs and houses
   - Draw aspect lines

6. **Interpret Results**
   - Identify Sun sign, Moon sign, Ascendant sign
   - Note any significant placements (e.g., stelliums, planets in domicile/exaltation)
   - List major aspects and their interpretations\
